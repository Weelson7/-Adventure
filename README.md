# !Adventure Game Project

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Documentation Structure

All game design documentation is located in the `docs` folder. Each core feature has its own detailed file, following a unified template for consistency and future expansion.

### Documentation Template
See `docs/TEMPLATE.md` for the standard format used in all feature docs.

### Feature Documentation Files
- `world_generation.md`: World creation, tectonic plates, elevation, temperature, water bodies, regional features
- `biomes_geography.md`: Biome types, resources, hazards, transitions, micro-biomes
- `societies_clans_kingdoms.md`: Clans, kingdoms, relationships, diplomacy, loyalty
- `structures_ownership.md`: Buildings, rooms, upgrades, ownership, legacy effects
- `objects_crafting_legacy.md`: Items, crafting, magic, durability, legacy/story system
- `characters_stats_traits_skills.md`: Playable/NPC races, stats, traits, skills, bestiary
- `stories_events.md`: Story creation, event triggers, lore, local impact
- `game_parameters_setup.md`: Worldgen parameters, presets, debug mode, modularity

Each file contains:
- Overview
- Core Concepts
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Generation & Initialization
- Interactions & Edge Cases
- Expansion & Modularity
- Open Questions

Expand or update any section as the project evolves. Suggestions and unresolved questions are included for ongoing development.
